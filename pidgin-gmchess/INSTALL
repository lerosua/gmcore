- Installing on Linux -

Simply run, as root:
 make all install

Or, if you do not have root access:
 make all install-user


- Installing on Windows -

Use the binary!

If you really want to compile this,
I recommend first making sure that you
can compile pidgin itself from source.

Our Makefile.mingw file is yet incomplete.
For now, copy fonomobutton.c into 
pidgin-X.X.X/pidgin/plugins/,
edit Makefile.mingw... run
 make -f Makefile.mingw
